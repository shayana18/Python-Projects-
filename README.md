# Snake-Game-
The snake game is my largest implementation of object oriented programming. In this game the user is 
able to dictate the snake’s direction based on the key they press (up, down, left and right), if it is an 
allowed movement (ie. If the snakehead is already up then pressing up arrow does nothing). Further 
more the game randomizes the placement of the piece of food (purple dot) every time the snake eats it,
grows the snake when it does so and tracks the score (each piece of food eaten is +1). Lastly the game 
ends if the user hits their own snake’s tail or hits any of the walls
